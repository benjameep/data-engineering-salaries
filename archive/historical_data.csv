I’m the only data guy at a small company that’s been around for decades. The title isn’t data engineer but it’s what I do, plus an assortment of other things. Culture is OK. I’m being shafted on the pay and there are no growth paths. The #1 complaint from everyone I’ve spoken with is pay, for all positions. Many have been open for months. I’ve been sending out resumes ever since I realized this position is a dead end, which was almost immediately. I can’t see how this company won’t be dead in 5-10 years (coasting on reputation) if they don’t get their act together.",https://reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/t4clep/quarterly_salary_discussion/i23j86c/,data analyst

My company (including some of the IT folks) is unaware that there is a professional field out there called Data Engineering and hence the unusual title...despite sharing with them multiple times. Any coding/BI work is thought of as development/IT/software engineering.
It sometimes concerns me to think about how will the title affect my future career growth because all I do is data engineering tasks... but it is what it is. This has been the motivation to keep upskilling myself and hopefully, my title wouldn't be a factor for future opportunities/growth but my experiences will.",https://reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/11f8yxo/quarterly_salary_discussion/jgmz29n/,digital analyst
